## Outreach Priority

1. **Direct email** to Tier 1 companies (they have budget + immediate need)

3. **Discord posts** in agent builder channels
4. **Twitter threads** explaining inter-agent settlement problem
5. **Hacker News** Show HN post

## Value Proposition by Segment

### For Agent Framework Companies
"Your agents transact. They need receipts. MSR = cryptographic proof of value exchange between agents."

### For MCP Server Developers
"MCP handles tool calls. Primordia handles payment. integrate `make_msr()` after each billable operation."

### For Funded Startups
"You're building agent infrastructure. Settlement is a missing primitive. We charge 5 bps on netting volume only."
